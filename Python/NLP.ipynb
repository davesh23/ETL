      "what a surprise What a surprise the Sheraton was after reading some of the reviews. it would appear there is a massive difference in the rooms, the South tower being the best. Check in was very efficient and the room was lovely, very large with the most comfortable beds ever. The hotel as stated is in a fantastic location and the Wrentham Village outlet is well worth a visit for bargain shopping ( the bus picks up outside). The hotel bar is a little pricey ( not helped by the current dollar rate) but is a nice place to relax after a busy day shopping. There is a number of restaurants close by. A cab from the airport to the hotel can be cheaper than the shuttles depending what time of the day you go. If it is not rush hour it is just under $30. \n",

The hotel is very busy with conferences and evening parties so there is alot of people around all the time. The lobby is like a train station with the people coming through.
